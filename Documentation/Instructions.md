Objective:

Apply a design pattern you’ve learned to solve a real or hypothetical problem through a working prototype.
Instructions

1. Work in Your Group: Each group will develop a small prototype that demonstrates one selected desig- pattern in action (e.g., Singleton, Strategy, State, GRASP, etc.).
2. Identify a Problem (Pain Point)
    - Choose a realistic software problem or feature that would benefit from a design pattern.
    - Example: managing shared configurations (Singleton) or selecting algorithms at runtime (Strategy).
    - Clearly describe the problem and why a design pattern is appropriate.
3. Select and Apply the Pattern
    - Choose one pattern that best addresses the problem.
    - Implement a working prototype in any programming language.
    - Your prototype should clearly illustrate the structure and behavior of the chosen pattern.
4. Prepare a Brief Presentation (3 minutes)
    -Demonstrate your prototype.
    -Explain why you chose the pattern and how it improved maintainability, flexibility, or clarity.
    -Focus on communication and understanding, not full product completeness.
5. Prepare Interview-Style Questions (10 minutes)
    -There will be a short set of interview questions related to Design Patterns.
    -Each group member must be prepared to answer one question on the spot.
    -Each member will have 2 minutes to respond, failure to answer effectively will result in a 50% deduction from that member’s assignment grade.
6. Submission
    -Upload a short report (1–2 pages) and your code or video demo.
    -Include your Group ID, pattern name, and member names.
